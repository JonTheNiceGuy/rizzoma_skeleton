Rizzoma Skeleton
================

This set of scripts builds on the [Rizzoma Collaboration Platform](https://github.com/rizzoma/rizzoma) to help those of us that want to hack on it, do so. The actual application is pulled from the Rizzoma main tree, and this just gives you enough setup to get running.
